/**
 * Correct common EPML errors.
 *
 * Because the EPML 2.0 XML schema has a bug which prevents validation, EPML documents in practice have
 * a range of common deviations from the schema.  As long as an EPML document is at least well-formed XML,
 * the XSLT transform <code>preprocess-epml.xsl</code> corrects the following errors:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the <code>&lt;epml&gt;</code> element is not namespaced, a namespace declaration is added.</li> 
 * <li>If no <code>&lt;coordinates&gt;</code> element is present, one is added.</li>
 * <li>If EPCs appear outside a <code>&lt;directory&gt;</code> element, a top-level directory is added.</li>
 * <li>An <code>id</code> attribute occurring on an <code>&lt;epc&gt;</code> element is changed to an
 *     <code>epcId</code>.</li>
 * <li>If an <code>&lt;arc&gt;</code> has the same <code>id</code> attribute as another EPC component, it
 *     is assigned a new unique </code>id</code> number.  The assumption is that arcs are never referenced
 *     by other components.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The corrected EPML is intended to be schema valid with respect to the (corrected) EPML 2.0 XML schema,
 * but this is neither guaranteed nor confirmed by this class.  Validation may be performed separately
 * upon the corrected document.
 *
 * Note that even if an EPML document is not schema-valid, it may still be acceptable input to JAXB.
