/**************************************************************************
 * File: Dijkstra.java
 * Author: Keith Schwarz (htiek@cs.stanford.edu)
 *
 * An implementation of Dijkstra's single-source shortest path algorithm.
 * The algorithm takes as input a directed graph with non-negative edge
 * costs and a source node, then computes the shortest path from that node
 * to each other node in the graph.
 *
 * The algorithm works by maintaining a priority queue of nodes whose
 * priorities are the lengths of some path from the source node to the
 * node in question.  At each step, the algortihm dequeues a node from
 * this priority queue, records that node as being at the indicated
 * distance from the source, and then updates the priorities of all nodes
 * in the graph by considering all outgoing edges from the recently-
 * dequeued node to those nodes.
 *
 * In the course of this algorithm, the code makes up to |E| calls to
 * decrease-key on the heap (since in the worst case every edge from every
 * node will yield a shorter path to some node than before) and |V| calls
 * to dequeue-min (since each node is removed from the prioritiy queue
 * at most once).  Using a Fibonacci heap, this gives a very good runtime
 * guarantee of O(|E| + |V| lg |V|).
 *
 * This implementation relies on the existence of a FibonacciHeap class, also
 * from the Archive of Interesting Code.  You can find it online at
 *
 *         http://keithschwarz.com/interesting/code/?dir=fibonacci-heap
