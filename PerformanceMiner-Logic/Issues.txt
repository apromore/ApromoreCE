Search and try OSGi library for joda-time
	- Issue with joda-time: how to make it OSGi
	- Understand differen ways and tools to do it: Embedded, Import-Package, bndtools, Eclipse plug-in development.
	- One way of creating an OSGi bundle from existing jars is using bndtools, but it does not ensure the new bundle works, manual investigation is required which eventually may require source code understanding of the libary (see BNDtools web site)
	- I chose a quick way by searching for any existing bundle available.
	- Found servicemix joda time 2.3
	- But we are using springsource joda-time 1.6.2 which does not provide needed functions
	- Make changes to apromore-manager and others to remove springsource joda-time 1.6.2. 
	- Due to an unknown issue, cannot start virgo when both versions coexit: this issue costed me two days with trial and errors
	- Test with servicemix joda-time 2.3
	- Finally I understood that the third-party libraries dependency must be declared in apromore-manager since I install it through pickup folder. When the server is running, if I drop it in pickup folder, the server does not have the joda-time bundle loaded yet. Another option is to install that bundle manually on Virgo admin web site.
	- Found OSGi? No, thanks discussion forum: OSGi is too complicated for application developers. It is only good for platforms, not for applications.
	- Learn about import with uses directive
	- Learn about dependency management by OSGi containers
	- Difference between dependencyManagement and dependencies in pom files.
	- Learn about apromore-assembly packages: all dependency files are copied from module target folder to assembly repository folder, then when Virgo is run, they are copied to virgo repository. So, we don't need to run mvn clean install for the whole Apromore (wait too long), but just to do for these modules and then run Virgo again.
	- We can use Virgo admin to deploy a bundle if we want to make sure its dependencies are resolved.
	- So first, we need to rebuild apromore-manager, then go to manager-assembly to rebuild this assembly.
	- Learn about virgo plans: they are stored in the apromore-assembly package.
	- To start virgo without having to copying files: we can move to the virgo installation folder, run startup.bat, rather than running ant start-virgo.
	- We should use the Virgo admin console more frequently to deploy/undeploy bundles while we are working, rather than adding them in pom files taking much longer.

Search for jfreechart OSGj: found springsource 1.0.12: tested OK.

Search for Apache Derby OSGi driver
	- Found servicemix osgi for Apache Derby 10.9.1.0_1. However, this bundle depends on org.w3c.dom.xpath
	- Found org.w3c.dom.xpath 1.3.4 in com.springsource.org.apache.xmlcommons osgi
	- Add these two new bundles to apromore-manager pom
	- However, start virgo error:
	A Require-Bundle could not be resolved because of a uses directive conflict. Resolver error data <Require-Bundle: org.springframework.aop; bundle-version="[3.1.0,4.0.0)">. Caused by missing constraint in bundle <org.apromore.pql-indexer_1.1.0>
             constraint: <Require-Bundle: org.springframework.aop; bundle-version="[3.1.0,4.0.0)">
	- Note: 
		- com.springsource.com.sun.xml.bind-2.2.0.jar imports org.w3c.dom version="0"
		- org.apache.servicemix.bundles.wsdl4j exports org.w3c.dom version 1.2
	- Search in virgo log, found conflicts related to the new bundles which might be the culprit:
	    package        'org.w3c.dom_1.3.0' in bundle 'org.eclipse.osgi_3.8.1.v20120830-144521[0]' used by 'org.eclipse.gemini.blueprint.blueprint.config_1.0.2.RELEASE' in bundle 'org.eclipse.gemini.blueprint.core_1.0.2.RELEASE[23]'
        conflicts with 'org.w3c.dom_1.3.4' in bundle 'com.springsource.org.apache.xmlcommons_1.3.4[93]' used by 'org.springframework.transaction.aspectj_3.1.0.RELEASE' in bundle 'org.springframework.aspects_3.1.0.RELEASE[211]'
	But cannot find 'org.w3c.dom_1.3.0' in bundle 'org.eclipse.osgi_3.8.1.v20120830-144521[0]' if we view the MANIFEST.MF file. WHY????
	It only appears in org.eclipse.osgi_3.8.1.v20120830-144521 if we view it in the Equinox console: telnet localhost 2501 packages command
	Check packages org.w3c.dom.xpath: no bundle exports it.
	But org.w3c.dom.xpath is a fundamental and essential package in JRE, why not available in Eclipse OSGi
	Same issue posted here: https://blog.tfd.co.uk/2009/04/10/loading-from-osgi-framework-bundles/
	Read "Configuring OSGi Framework Bundles" in Virgo documentation
	Read Virgo documentation, learn that bundles loading can be configured. However, fundamental bundles are included in Equinox OSGi container framework implementation org.eclipse.osgi, and it does not contain org.w3c.dom.xpath
	Read "Configuring OSGi Framework Profile": edit file java6-server.profile. Note that in this file org.w3c.dom.xpath is not available
	Note: the packages in the framework would be added to the Export-Packages section of the org.eclipse.osgi bundle.
	But org.w3c.dom.xpath is available at http://git.eclipse.org/c/equinox/rt.equinox.framework.git/tree/bundles/org.eclipse.osgi/JavaSE-1.6.profile
	Found Apache Derby already supports OSGi

Class.forName issue: 
	- refer to http://njbartlett.name/2010/08/30/osgi-readiness-loading-classes.html
	- http://freemanfang.blogspot.com/2012/03/how-to-use-jdbc-driver-in-osgi.html
	- Cannot find a way to use Import Package
	- Finally, use Embedded Depedency works.

highcharts: how to integrate it into the web site:
	- Insert the high-chart libraries into the apromore-portal index.zul file.
	- Not to do this for every page.
	- How to use HighChart in ZK: finally, we use highcharts separately, not the one integrated with ZK

ZK Window:
	- How to load data into HighChart component dynamically? chart.series[0].setData(mySeries)
	- What ZK window event to apply the above functional call?
	- How to use JSON.parse in ZK
	- How to use jQuery in ZK

	Migrate stage mining
	- Select javascript library for graph
	- Select GoJS: simple, and strong library.
	- If has "\n" (newline character) in the node text, always encounter javascript error: ZK has problem with "\n" character, while if displaying the graph in HTML/Javascript page only we have no problem
	- Replace \n character with comma: OK

Apromore crash: for an unknown reason, cannot run virgo. The build process is OK for all modules, but starting virgo encounters NullPointerException and PluginException.
	- Cannot find the reason
	- Download new Apromore and run: OK

- JFreeChart Error:
	- Use Import-Package with jFreechart osgi (incl. JCommon) from springsource and servicemix.
	- It can run OK for many times
	- One day, it raised this error: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.jfree.data.time.TimeTableXYDataset.add(Lorg/jfree/data/time/TimePeriod;DLjava/lang/Comparable;)
	- And since then, this error persists, whatever osgi jfreechart and jcommon used.
	- Then, have to use Embed-Dependency
