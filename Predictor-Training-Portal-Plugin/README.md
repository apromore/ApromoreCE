# Nirdizati Training UI

Project made as a bachelors thesis in University of Tartu.

This project is a part of a bigger system called [Nirdizati](http://nirdizati.org/).

Source code for Nirdizati can be found [here](https://github.com/nirdizati).

## What is Nirdizati?

Nirdizati is an open-source web-based predictive process monitoring engine for running business processes. The dashboard is updated periodically based on incoming streams of events. However, unlike classical monitoring dashboards, Nirdizati does not focus on showing the current state of business process executions, but also their future state (e.g. when will each case finish). On the backend, Nirdizati uses predictive models pre-trained using data about historical process execution.

More information on this can be found [here](https://eprints.qut.edu.au/109686/).

## What is the goal of this project?

Nirdizati Training component provides possibility for user to upload his own logs in ```.XES``` or ```.CSV``` format, analyze them, construct models using different parameters and then depoy them into Nirdizati Runtime component.

Goal of this project is to remake UI for Nirdizati training component. As a result, Nirdizati Training UI will be remade into more user-friendly and intuitive system.
