                        This plugin accepts logs with some special conditions: (1) every trace must have an attribute named <b>status</b> of string type that defines the completion status of the case, 
                        e.g. statuses can be 'complete', 'declined', and 'cancelled'; (2) every event must have an attribute named <b>stage</b> of string type that defines which stage that event belongs to, 
                        e.g. stages can be helpdesk levels in IT incident handling or phases of loan application processing (e.g. admission, review, offer, negotiate, and finalization); 
                        (3) Events of the <b>same activity</b> must be in the same stage; (4) Stages in every case must follow a <b>consistent staging order</b>, e.g. stage1 followed by stage2 followed by stage3.
                        Running the plugin with logs not meeting these conditions may return less meaningful results or errors.
